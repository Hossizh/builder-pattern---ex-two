# builder-pattern---ex-two
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Builder Design Pattern, which is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. Instead of using a single constructor to create an object, the Builder pattern separates the construction logic, making it easier to create and customize objects with multiple attributes.
